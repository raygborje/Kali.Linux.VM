<h1>Kali Linux - Initial Setup & Troubleshooting Guide</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The Cyber Security Project involves the initial setup and troubleshooting of a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) using Oracle VM VirtualBox. Kali Linux is a popular Linux distribution widely used for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security auditing.

The project aims to provide a secure and isolated environment for conducting various security-related activities, such as vulnerability scanning, network analysis, and penetration testing. By setting up a Kali Linux VM, participants can gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques commonly employed by cybersecurity professionals.

The project involves the following steps:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of Oracle VM VirtualBox: Participants install the Oracle VM VirtualBox software on their host machine, ensuring compatibility with their operating system. This step may require system configuration adjustments to enable virtualization.

Obtaining Kali Linux: Participants download the Kali Linux ISO image from the official website. The ISO file contains the complete operating system and tools necessary for conducting security assessments.

Creating a Kali Linux VM: Using Oracle VM VirtualBox, participants create a new virtual machine and configure its settings. This includes allocating system resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage for optimal performance.

Installing Kali Linux: Participants mount the Kali Linux ISO image in the virtual machine and proceed with the installation. They follow the installation wizard to set up the operating system, create user accounts, and configure network settings.

Post-installation setup: After installing Kali Linux, participants update the system packages and repositories to ensure they have the latest versions of security tools. They may also customize the VM settings, install additional packages, or configure network adapters based on their project requirements.

Troubleshooting and Issue Resolution: Participants troubleshoot common issues that may arise during the setup process. This includes addressing network connectivity problems, resolving hardware conflicts, or resolving compatibility issues between the host machine and the virtual environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Throughout the project, participants gain practical knowledge of virtualization technologies, operating system installation and configuration, and troubleshooting techniques. They also become familiar with the Kali Linux ecosystem and its wide range of cybersecurity tools.

By successfully setting up and troubleshooting the Kali Linux VM, participants lay the foundation for performing various cybersecurity tasks within a secure and controlled environment. This project serves as an essential step towards developing practical skills in the field of cyber security and ethical hacking.
